## **GorillaType** 

### Description

*A typing test / game written in C, compiles and runs in the terminal.*

I have taken huge inspiration from [Monkeytype](https://www.monkeytype.com) , and the game plan is to replicate it on the console(to some extent).

### Functionality (current)

* [X] Typing mechanics
* [X] String matching
* [X] Basic ui to navigate the program.

### Functionality (to be added)

* [ ] Integrate a timer to score the user and analyse the results(wpm).
* [ ] Make and use a corpus of english words which will be the building blocks of the test string, so that the test strings always have some new challenge to offer. The complexity of the words chosen will be dependent on the user's choice.
